Description: The card game War is simple in its rules but can be lengthy. In
    another domain, the nonparametric bootstrap test with pooled resampling
    (nbpr) methods, as outlined in Dwivedi, Mallawaarachchi, and Alvarado (2017) <doi:10.1002/sim.7263>,
    is optimal for comparing paired or unpaired means in non-normal data,
    especially for small sample size studies. However, many researchers are
    unfamiliar with these methods. The 'bootwar' package bridges this gap by
    enabling users to grasp the concepts of nbpr via Boot War, a variation of the
    card game War designed for small samples. With the shuffle_cards() function,
    players can engage in Boot War using a standard 52-card deck, a custom deck
    created via an anonymous function, or interleaved custom decks where each
    player has their distinct deck. The package further provides functions like
    deal_card(), score_keeper(), and play_round() to streamline gameplay and
    scoring. Once a predetermined number of rounds concludes, users can employ
    the analyze_game() function to derive game results. This function leverages
    the 'npboottprm' package's nonparboot() to report nbpr results and, for
    comparative analysis, also reports results from the 'stats' package's t.test()
    function. Additionally, 'bootwar' features an interactive 'shiny' web
    application, bootwar(). This offers a user-centric interface to experience
    Boot War, enhancing understanding of nbpr methods across various distributions,
    sample sizes, number of bootstrap resamples, and confidence intervals.
