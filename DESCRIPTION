Description: The card game War has straightforward rules but can be
    time-consuming. On the other hand, nonparametric bootstrap test with
    pooled resampling methods as presented in Dwivedi, Mallawaarachchi, and Alvarado (2017) <doi:10.1002/sim.7263>
    is ideal for comparing paired or unpaired means for non-normal data in
    sample size studies. The goal of 'bootwar' is to help users gain better
    intuition for nonparametric bootstrap test with pooled resampling methods by
    playing Boot War, a small sample size variant of the card game War. The
    shuffle_cards() function allows users to play Boot War with a standard 52
    card deck, a anonymous deck created using an anonymous function, or an
    interleaved deck which allows the user to define a different deck for each
    player. The package includes functions deal_card(), score_keeper(), and
    play_round() to help control the flow and keep score of the game. After a
    user specified number of rounds are complete, the analyze_game() function
    can be used to obtain the results of the game. The analyze_game() function
    uses the nonparboot() function from the 'npboottprm' package in order to
    obtain the nonparametric bootstrap test with pooled resampling; moreover,
    to help users compare with standard methods, analyze_game() also returns the
    results from the 'stats' package's t.test() function. Further, 'bootwar'
    incorporates an interactive 'shiny' web application, bootwar(), offering
    a user-friendly way to play Boot War and further their intuition on
    nonparametric bootstrap test with pooled resampling methods.
